# Prioritized todo-list

1. Tutorial 01 - show first cosim.json file
2. console.error in test looks like an error in test.
3. Focus output channel on simulation run. Print status of simulation execution in output channel. Probably remove the notification on simulation failure.
4. Weird inconsistent spacing/tabs
5. Additional testing - increase coverage in unit tests
6. Setup Actions to build extension package
7. Demo video showing basic functionality of extension.
8. Documentation - MkDocs, for reference: <https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS/blob/feature/distributed-demo/docs/PUBLISH.md>

## v0.2.0 development

1. (later) cosim_studio.json --> to  be used for one cosimulation workspace. It can refer to multiple cosimulation configs - maestro host and port is moved to here.
2. (later) extension configuration, i.e. where is Maestro running
3. The project could benefit from a DI framework - consider this for a future release.
4. Look at activation events and extension configuration with a fixed name.
5. Display the resulting data from running a simulation in a table (look at old branches in repo for inspiration).
6. Add JSON schemas over the configs.
